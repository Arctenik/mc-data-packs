Also available as a [zipped data pack file](https://github.com/Arctenik/mc-data-packs/blob/zips/interpreters/Deadfish.zip)

To use the interpreter, run a command like this to initialize the program in the "code" tag of the deadfish storage:

And then run the function:

`/function deadfish:deadfish`
